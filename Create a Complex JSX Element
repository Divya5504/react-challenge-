Create a Complex JSX Element
The last challenge was a simple example of JSX, but JSX can represent more complex HTML as well.

One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.

For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.


const JSX = (
<div>
  <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>
  <p>Some info</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An item</li>
    <li>Another item</li>
    <li>A third item</li>
  </ul>
</div>);
